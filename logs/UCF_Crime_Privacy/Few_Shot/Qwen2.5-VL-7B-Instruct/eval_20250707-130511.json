The scene does not depict any violent incidents like assault; rather shows vehicles moving through what appears normal urban street conditions where cars stop for pedestrian crossings as expected during regular city life activities such driving past parked automobiles while people walk across streets accordingly within their designated crosswalks areas ensuring safety norms followed universally worldwide including USA cities too!
